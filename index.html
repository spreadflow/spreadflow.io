                processing engine.  Its main purpose is to support file based
                media production workflows by observing changes to text and
                media files in real-time.</p>

                <p>Information gathered through this process can be used to
                transform and recombine content, e.g., in order to prepare it
                for different publishing channels.</p>

                <h3>Documentation</h3>
                <p>Regrettably there is zero documentation so far. My hope is
                to find someone who is willing to share some production data
                (i.e. texts, layouts, images) which would allow me to provide
                tutorials. In my experience it is crucial for a FLOSS project
                to provide at least some well commented examples so people can
                tinker with the software.</p>
